# Infinite scrolling
is a technique where more content (in your case, images) loads automatically as the user scrolls down the page. This creates a seamless browsing experience without requiring pagination.

## How It Works:
  Initial Load: A set number of images load when the page first opens.
  
  Scroll Detection: JavaScript detects when the user nears the bottom of the page.
  
  Data Fetching: More images are fetched (from a server or a local source).
  
  Appending Data: New images are added to the existing content without refreshing the page.
  
  Repeat: This cycle continues until all images are loaded or a set limit is reached.

  
## Basic Workflow for Your Project:

### HTML: A container to hold images.

### CSS: Optional, to style the images.

### JavaScript: To handle scroll detection and load images.
